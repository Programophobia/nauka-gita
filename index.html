                Starscourge Radahn
                is heralded as one of the mightiest<br>
                living demigods, having fought Malenia <br>
                the Severed to a standstill during <br>
                the war of the Shattering. However, <br>
                his resulting affliction with the <br>
                Scarlet Rot caused him to be driven <br>
                to insanity, crippling him and reducing <br>
                him to a state of feral rage. <br>
                He is located in Caelid, where he can <br>
                be accessed from Redmane Castle after<br>
                activating the Radahn Festival by <br>
                progressing far enough in Ranni's questline, <br>
                or activating any site of grace in Altus Plateau.</p>
